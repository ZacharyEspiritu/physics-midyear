                    <h3>About the Study Guide</h3>
                    <p>Welcome to the Physics Mid-Year Study Guide 2016! If you're studying this guide, you probably have some vague desire of some kind to not fail Physics this trimester, so give yourself a pat on the back for taking the first step. This guide is structured in 6 acts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#intro">Overview</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#chapter2">Chapter 2: Kinematics in One Dimension</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#chapter3">Chapter 3: Kinematics in Two Dimensions</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#chapter4">Chapter 4: Forces</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#chapter5">Chapter 5: Gravitation</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#chapter6">Chapter 6: Work &amp; Energy</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Depending on how far back you are on your studying, you may wish to skim or even skip certain sections in the interest of time. If you're doing this, ideally you already know what you know and what you don't know so you can study what you don't know so you know it by the time you take the test (and if you don't know, it's probably circular motion). I've included some recommended study plans in this section which give you the best tips depending on how much time you have left to study, whether it's one week or a single all-nighter the day of the exam.</p>
                    <p>A few random tidbits: For easy navigation, I've included some anchor links (remember those from Computer Science?) in the sidebar to the left as you scroll to easily jump back and forth between sections. Also, if you're the type of person who likes to see things on a piece of paper, I've programmed this website such that it will automatically come out in a print-friendly format simply by printing normally from your browser.</p>
                    <p>Good luck on your studying escapades!</p>
                    <h3>About the Physics Midyear</h3>
                    <p>Just like the AP exam and the broken arm I had in the fifth grade, the Physics Midyear will be split in two parts.</p>
                    <h4>Part A: Multiple Choice</h4>
                    <p>You will have to answer <b>20 multiple choice questions</b> on the test, each one worth <b>2 points each.</b> These questions each have 4 answer choices from which you will have to choose the correct answer. (You could choose the incorrect answer, but I don't think that will help you in the long run.)</p>
                    <p>If you do the math, you'll realize that Part A is worth <b>40 points total.</b></p>
                    <h4>Part B: Free-response Questions</h4>
                    <p>You wil have to complete <b>6 free-response, multi-part questions</b> on the test, each one worth <b>10 points each.</b> Since the Physics gods are somewhat merciful, you'll have the opportunity to <b>choose 6 questions out of 10 questions</b> on the test. However, note that the Physics gods are still evil at heart, so you'll notice much, much, <em>much</em> overlap between the available questions on the test, so don't plan on skipping one problem type entirely.</p>
                    <p>Part B is worth <b>60 points total.</b></p>
                    <h3>Suggested Study Plans</h3>
                    <p>Depending on how much time you have, the suggested study plans below can help you get the most out of the little time you have:</p>
                    <h4>1) It's Monday, December 27 — 9 days before the exam.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Re-read over all the material in approximately 3 days.</li>
                        <li>Do a practice problem from each chapter once a day. Six problems should take you one hour, since that's about how much time you have on the test.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>3) It's Saturday, January 1 — 5 days before the exam.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Happy New Year!</li>
                        <li>You may also be volunteering at Interview Day, so you actually have less time.</li>
                        <li>Depending on how well you've done in Physics tests past, you may wish to skip Chapter 2 and Chapter 3.</li>
                        <li>Do one or two practice problems from each chapter once a day. Nine problems should take you 90 minutes each day.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>4) It's Monday, January 4 — 2 days before the exam.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Depending on how well you've done in Physics tests past, you may wish to skip Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Newton's Laws of Motion and Mass vs Weight in Chapter 4, Uniform Circular Motion in Chapter 5, and Kinetic vs Potential Energy in Chapter 6.</li>
                        <li>Do two practice problems from each chapter once a day. Twelve problems should take you 2 hours each day.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr>

                    <h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2: Kinematics in One Dimension</h2>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>In this system of just me and you, where I've defined negative to refer to the downwards direction, my acceleration is currently &ndash;9.8 m/s for you.</p>
                        <footer>A Valentine's Day card</footer>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Chapter 2 contains material covering kinematics material in a single dimension. You'll be working on number lines for the majority of this chapter.</p>
                    <p>I'm assuming by this point you all know the standard kinematics equations for constant acceleration:</p>
                    <div class="equation-block">$$v = v_0 + at$$</div>
                    <div class="equation-block">$$x = x_0 + {v_0}t + {1 \over 2}at^2$$</div>
                    <div class="equation-block">$$v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a{\Delta x}$$</div>
                    <p>You'll be using these a lot.</p>

                    <h3 id="referenceFrames">Reference Frames</h3>
                    <img src="img/referenceFrames.png" class="img-responsive pull-right">
                    <p>All of physics is measured relative to something else. The conceptual idea of reference frames is best explained by the image here: from your frame of reference on the ground, the boy is moving from left to right; from the boy's frame of reference, he is standing still.</p>
                    <p>Before doing any measurements in physics, we must define our reference frame. For most problems, this means you must define:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> axes</li>
                        <li>The direction that positive (+) and negative (-) signs refer to</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This will become especially important when dealing with vectors.</p>

                    <h3 id="displacement">Displacement</h3>
                    <p>Displacement is defined as <b>the change in position of an object</b>. In other words, how far the object is from the starting point.</p>
                    <p>Displacement is a <b>vector quantity</b>, so make sure to include both magnitude and direction in your answer.</p>
                    <div class="panel panel-info">
                        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Example problem:</h3></div>
                        <div class="panel-body">
                            <p>A person walks 70 meters west and 30 meters east. What is their displacement?</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3 id="speedVsVelocity">Speed vs Velocity</h3>
                    <p>Speed is the measure of how fast an object is moving. The <b>average speed</b> of an object is defined as:</p>
                    <div class="equation-block">$$average\ speed = {total\ distance\ travelled \over time\ elapsed}$$</div>
                    <p>On the other hand, velocity is the measure of how fast <em>and in what direction</em> an object is moving (it's a <em>vector quantity!</em>). The numerical value of "how fast" is also known as the <b>magnitude</b>. <b>Average velocity</b> is defined as <em>the displacement of an object over the time elapsed:</em></p>
                    <div class="equation-block">$$\bar v = {x_2 - x_1 \over t_2 - t_1} = {\Delta x \over \Delta t}$$</div>
                    <p>It's important to note that average speed uses <em>total distance</em> in its measurement as opposed to velocity, which uses <em>displacement</em> in its calculation. As a result, average speed and average velocity can be different for the same system.</p>
                    <div class="panel panel-info">

                    <p>Cat physics jokes aside, Chapter 4 is all about the relationship between force and motion.</p>
                    <p>As we all should know by now, a <b>force</b> is any type of push or pull on a object. They are vector quantities, so they have both magnitude and direction. The important (and slightly unintunitive) thing to remember about forces is that <em>an object will continue to remain at rest</em> or <em>move at constant speed if no force is being applied to it</em>. In other words, an object only will slow down or speed up if a force is applied on it.</p>

                    <h3 id="newtonsLaws">Newton's Laws of Motion</h3>
                    <p>Newton's three laws of motion describe the behavior of objects when forces are applied to them. For the test, expect some of the multiple choice questions in Part 1 to use concepts from Newton's First and Third Law of Motion, and to use Newton's Second Law of Motion in Part 2.</p>
                    <h4>First Law of Motion</h4>
                    <blockquote>Every object continues in its state of rest, or of uniform velocity in a straight line, as long as no net force acts on it.</blockquote>
                    <p>As we all should know by now, a <b>force</b> is any type of push or pull on a object. Newton's first law of motion describes an important (and slightly unintunitive) thing to remember about forces is that <em>an object will continue to remain at rest</em> or <em>move at constant speed if no force is being applied to it</em>. In other words, an object only will slow down or speed up if a force is applied on it.</p>
                    <p>This tendency of an object to maintain its state of rest or uniform motion is called <b>inertia</b>.</p>
                    <h4>Second Law of Motion</h4>
                    <blockquote>The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it, and is inversely proportional to its mass. The direction of the acceleration is in the direction of the net force action on the object.</blockquote>
                    <p>Newton's second law of motion is best known in its equation form:</p>
                    <div class="equation-block">$$\sum\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$$</div>

                            <p>We'll define the car's motion as along the positive x-axis. We know that that the initial velocity \(v_0 = 28\ \mathrm{m/s}\), the final velocity \(v = 0\), and the distance \(\Delta{x} = 55\ \mathrm{m}\).</p>
                            <p>In order to determine the force, we still need to find \(a\), so let's set up a kinematic equation:</p>

                            <p>Now, we can plug our values into \(F = ma\) and solve for \(F\):</p>

                    <p>Newton's third law of motion is more commonly known as "to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction". The important thing to note here is that the "action" force and the "reaction" force are acting on <b>different objects.</b></p>
                    <p>A good example of Newton's third law in action are cars. The tires of a moving car push backward against the ground because of friction, and the ground pushes on the tires in the opposite direction, accelerating the car forward.</p>

                    <h3 id="friction">Friction</h3>
                    <p>There are two types of friction: <b>kinetic friction</b> and <b>static friction</b>.</p>
                    <h4>Kinetic Friction</h4>
                    <p>
                        Kinetic friction occurs when two objects slide against one another. It is proportional to the normal force exerted by the object:
                    </p>
                    <div class="equation-block">$$F_{f} = {\mu}_k F_N$$</div>
                    <p>Here, \(\mathbf{{\mu}_k}\) refers to the <em>coefficient of kinetic friction</em>, which can only be determined experimentally. As a result, many of the problems you will encounter will either provide the value of \(\mu\) for you or have you solve directly for \(\mu\).</p>
                    <h4>Static Friction</h4>
                    <p>Static friction refers to a force parallel to two surfaces in contact with each other when the two objects are not sliding. The equation used is similar to kinetic friction, albeit with a few changes:</p>
                    <div class="equation-block">$$F_{f} \le {\mu}_s F_N$$</div>
                    <p>Here, \(\mathbf{{\mu}_s}\) refers to the <em>coefficient of static friction</em> (not to be confused with \(\mathbf{{\mu}_k}\)). We use a \(\le\) sign here as the force of static friction can vary from zero to the maximum value given by \({\mu}_s F_N\).</p>
                    <p>This concept of changing static friction is best demonstrated by pushing on a heavy table. When you're not pushing on the table, the floor is not exerting any horizontal force on the table. However, if you begin to push horizontally on the table, and the table doesn't move, the floor has begun to exert the force of static friction against the table. Incresaing the force of pushing will also increase the force of static friction until it reaches its upper bound (given by the above equation), at which point the table will begin to move.</p>

                            <p>To solve this problem, we'll draw a free-body diagram for each of the boxes, as shown in the  second figure. We also know that the horizontal accleration of box \(A\) must be equal to the vertical accleration of box \(B\). More on that later.</p>
                            <p>We know that box \(A\) doesn't move vertically, so Newton's second law tells us the normal force is equal to the weight:</p>
                            <div class="equation-block">$$F_{\mathrm{N}} = m_{\mathrm{A}}g = (5.0\ \mathrm{kg})(9.8\ \mathrm{m/s^2}) = 49\ \mathrm{N}$$</div>
                            <p>In the horizontal direction, there are two forces on box \(A\): \(F_{\mathrm{T}}\), the tension in the cord (which we don't know yet), and the force of friction, \(F_{\mathrm{fr}}\). We'll start by solving for \(F_{\mathrm{fr}}\):</p>
                            <div class="equation-block">$$F_{\mathrm{fr}} = \mu_{\mathrm{k}}F_{\mathrm{N}} = (0.20)(49\ \mathrm{N}) = 9.8\ \mathrm{N}$$</div>
                            <p>We want to solve for the horizontal acceleration of box A, so let's set up a force equation that will let us do that:</p>
                            <div class="equation-block">$$\sum F_{\mathrm{Ax}} = F_{\mathrm{T}} - F_{\mathrm{fr}} = m_{\mathrm{A}}a$$</div>
                            <p>Now, let's consider box B. Let's solve for \(m_{\mathrm{B}}g\):</p>
                            <div class="equation-block">$$m_{\mathrm{B}}g = (2.0\ \mathrm{kg})(9.8\ \mathrm{m/s^2}) = 19.6\ \mathrm{N}$$</div>
                            <p>Since we want to solve for the vertical accleration of box \(B\), let's setup our force equation:</p>
                            <div class="equation-block">$$\sum F_{\mathrm{Bx}} = m_{\mathrm{B}}g - F_{\mathrm{T}} = m_{\mathrm{B}}a$$</div>
                            <p>Using our box \(A\) equation from earlier, we can solve for \(F_{\mathrm{T}}\) and substitute into our box \(B\) equation:</p>
                            <div class="equation-block">$$F_{\mathrm{T}} = m_{\mathrm{A}}a + F_{\mathrm{fr}}$$</div>
                            <div class="equation-block">$$m_{\mathrm{B}}g - m_{\mathrm{A}}a - F_{\mathrm{fr}} = m_{\mathrm{B}}a$$</div>
                            <p>We can now solve for \(a\) and plug in our values:</p>
                            <div class="equation-block">\begin{align} m_{\mathrm{B}}g - m_{\mathrm{A}}a - F_{\mathrm{fr}} & = m_{\mathrm{B}}a \\ m_{\mathrm{B}}a + m_{\mathrm{A}}a & = m_{\mathrm{B}}g - F_{\mathrm{fr}} \\ a & = {m_{\mathrm{B}}g - F_{\mathrm{fr}} \over m_{\mathrm{B}} + m_{\mathrm{A}}} \\ a & = {19.6\ \mathrm{N} - 9.8\ \mathrm{N} \over 5.0\ \mathrm{kg} + 2.0\ \mathrm{kg}} \approx 1.4\ \mathrm{m/s^2} \end{align}</div>

                    <p>An object that moves in a circle at constant speed \(v\) is said to experience <b>uniform circular motion</b>. The <em>magnitude</em> of the velocity remains constant throughout the object's motion, but the <em>direction</em> of the velocity is constantly changing.</p>
                    <p>Because acceleration is defined as a change of velocity, an object undergoing uniform circular motion is <em>constantly changing velocity</em>.</p>
                    <p>We can calculate the <b>acceleration</b> of an object undergoing uniform circular motion as follows:</p>

                    <p>The accleration vector always points towards the center of the circle.</p>
                    <p>We can also create an equation to determine the <b>velocity</b> of an object undergoing uniform circular motion:</p>

                    <p>The <b>work</b> done on an object by a <b>constant force</b> can be defined via the following equation:</p>

In simpler terms, \(F\cos{\theta}\) refers to the magnitude of the force parallel to \(d\).</p>
                    <p>Work is measured in <b>joules</b> (J).</p>

                    <p>In its simplest terms, energy is defined as "the ability to do work". There are two types of energy: kinetic and potential.</p>
                    <h4>Kinetic Energy</h4>
                    <p><b>Kinetic energy</b> is the energy associated with an object in motion. It can be calculated via the following equation:</p>
                    <div class="equation-block">$$\mathrm{KE} = {1 \over 2}mv^2$$</div>
                    <p>The work done by a force is equal to the change in kinetic energy:</p>
                    <div class="equation-block">\begin{align} W_\mathrm{net} & = \mathrm{KE}_2 - \mathrm{KE}_1 \\ W_\mathrm{net} & = {1 \over 2}mv_2^2 - {1 \over 2}mv_1^2 \end{align}</div>
                    <div class="panel panel-info">
                        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Example problem:</h3></div>

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Potential Energy</h4>
                    <p><b>Potential energy</b> is the energy associated with forces that depend on the position of an object relative to its surroundings. For the purposes of this test, you need to be familiar with two types of potential energy: gravitational potential energy, discussed below, and elastic potential energy, which will be discussed in the Springs section.</p>
                    <p><b>Gravitational potential energy</b> can be calculated with the following equation:</p>
                    <div class="equation-block">$$\mathrm{PE}_\mathrm{grav} = mgh$$</div>
                    <h3 id="springs">Springs</h3>
                    <p>To compress a spring some distance \(x\), a force \(F_\mathrm{P}\) must be applied that is directly proportional to \(x\):</p>
                    <div class="equation-block">$$F_\mathrm{P} = kx$$</div>
                    <p>Here, \(k\) refers to the <em>spring stiffness constant</em>, and is a measure of the stiffness of the particular spring. The problems you'll be encountering will usually give you what \(k\) is equal to upfront, but some may have you determine the value of \(k\) algebraically.</p>
                    <p>In addition, springs have <b>elastic potential energy</b> when compressed <em>or</em> stretched. It can be calculated with the following equation:</p>
                    <div class="equation-block">$$\mathrm{PE}_\mathrm{elastic} = {1 \over 2}kx^2$$</div>

                    <h3 id="energyConservation">Conservation of Energy</h3>
                    <p>We all know about the Law of Conservation of Energy, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted to another form. The majority of the forces you'll be encountering are <b>conservative forces</b>, which keep all the energy exerted inside of the system.</p>
                    <p>However, there also exists <b>nonconservative forces</b>, which release energy outside of the system. An example of this is <em>friction</em>&mdash;when a box is pushed against a rough surface, some of the energy is released into the surrounding area as heat energy.</p>

                    <h3 id="mechanicalEnergy">Mechanical Energy</h3>
                    <p>Assuming we are <em>only dealing with conservative forces</em>, <b>mechanical energy</b> is defined as the sum of the kinetic and potential energies in a system at any given moment:</p>
                    <div class="equation-block">$$E = \mathrm{KE} + \mathrm{PE}$$</div>
                    <p>You'll usually use this concept to compare energy changes in a system at different points in time:</p>
                    <div class="equation-block">$$\mathrm{KE}_2 + \mathrm{PE}_2 = \mathrm{KE}_1 + \mathrm{PE}_1$$</div>

We want to find \(v_2\) when the rock is at position (\y_2 = 2.0\ \mathrm{m}\). We can set up our conservation equation as such:</p>

                            <p>The \(m\)'s cancel out, allowing us to solve for \(v_2\):</p>
                            <div class="equation-block">\begin{align} {1 \over 2}v_2^2 + gh_2 & = {1 \over 2}v_1^2 + gh_1 \\ v_2^2 & = 2g(h_1 - h_2) \\ & = 2(9.8\ \mathrm{m/s^2})[(3.0\ \mathrm{m}) - (1.0\ \mathrm{m})] \\ & = 2(9.8\ \mathrm{m/s^2})(2.0\ \mathrm{m}) \approx 39.2\ \mathrm{m^2/s^2} \end{align}</div>
                            <p>We can then take the square root to get our answer.</p>
