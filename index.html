                    <h3>About the Study Guide</h3>
                    <p>Welcome to the Physics Mid-Year Study Guide 2016! If you're studying this guide, you probably have some vague desire of some kind to not fail Physics this trimester, so give yourself a pat on the back for taking the first step. This guide is structured in 7 acts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#intro">Overview</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#chapter2">Chapter 2: Kinematics in One Dimension</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#chapter3">Chapter 3: Kinematics in Two Dimensions</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#chapter4">Chapter 4: Newton's Laws</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#chapter5">Chapter 5: Gravitation</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#chapter6">Chapter 6: Work &amp; Energy</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#practice">Practice Problems</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Depending on how far back you are on your studying, you may wish to skim or even skip certain sections in the interest of time. If you're doing this, ideally you already know what you know and what you don't know so you can study what you don't know so you know it by the time you take the test (and if you don't know, it's probably circular motion). I've included some recommended study plans in this section which give you the best tips depending on how much time you have left to study, whether it's one week or a single all-nighter the day of the exam.</p>
                    <p>A few random tidbits: For easy navigation, I've included some anchor links (remember those from Computer Science I?) in the sidebar to the left as you scroll to easily jump back and forth between sections. Also, if you're the type of person who likes to see things on a piece of paper, I've programmed this website such that it will automatically come out in a print-friendly format simply by printing normally from your browser.</p>
                    <p>Good luck on your studying escapades!</p>
                    <h3>About the Physics Midyear</h3>
                    <p>Just like the AP exam and the broken arm I had in the fifth grade, the Physics Midyear will be split in two parts.</p>
                    <h4>Part A: Multiple Choice</h4>
                    <p>You will have to answer <b>20 multiple choice questions</b> on the test, each one worth <b>2 points each.</b> These questions each have 4 answer choices from which you will have to choose the correct answer. (You could choose the incorrect answer, but I don't think that will help you in the long run.)</p>
                    <p>If you do the math, you'll realize that Part A is worth <b>40 points total.</b></p>
                    <h4>Part B: Free-response Questions</h4>
                    <p>You wil have to complete <b>6 free-response, multi-part questions</b> on the test, each one worth <b>10 points each.</b> Since the Physics gods are somewhat merciful, you'll have the opportunity to <b>choose 6 questions out of 10 questions</b> on the test. However, note that the Physics gods are still evil at heart, so you'll notice much, much, <em>much</em> overlap between the available questions on the test, so don't plan on skipping one problem type entirely.</p>
                    <p>Part B is worth <b>60 points total.</b></p>
                    <h3>Suggested Study Plans</h3>
                    <p>Depending on how much time you have, the suggested study plans below can help you get the most out of the little time you have:</p>
                    <h4>1) It's Sunday, December 27 — 10 days before the exam.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Re-read over all the material in approximately 3 days.</li>
                        <li>Do a practice problem from each chapter once a day. Six problems should take you one hour, since that's about how much time you have on the test.</li>
                        <li>Get an HH.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>2) It's Thursday, December 31 — 6 days before the exam.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Depending on how well you've done in Physics tests past, you may wish to skip the majority of Chapter 2 but take another look at Graphical Analysis just in case. You also may wish to skip both Vector sections in Chapter 3. The rest of the material should take you about 2.5 days.</li>
                        <li>Do a practice problem from each chapter once a day. Six problems should take you one hour each day.</li>
                        <li>Get an H—HH.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>3) It's Saturday, January 2 — 4 days before the exam.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You may also be volunteering at Interview Day, so you have even less time.</li>
                        <li>Depending on how well you've done in Physics tests past, you may wish to skip Chapter 2, Chapter 3, and Newton's Laws of Motion and Mass vs Weight in Chapter 4.</li>
                        <li>Do one or two practice problems from each chapter once a day. Nine problems should take you 90 minutes each day.</li>
                        <li>Get an M—H.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>4) It's Monday, January 4 — 2 days before the exam.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Depending on how well you've done in Physics tests past, you may wish to skip Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Newton's Laws of Motion and Mass vs Weight in Chapter 4, Uniform Circular Motion in Chapter 5, and Kinetic vs Potential Energy in Chapter 6.</li>
                        <li>Do two practice problems from each chapter once a day. Twelve problems should take you 2 hours each day.</li>
                        <li>Get an M.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Insert some vague Physics joke about Kinematics.</p>
                        <footer>From WWF's website</footer>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Chapter 2 contains material covering kinematics material in a single dimension. You'll be working on number lines for the majority of this chapter.</p>

                    <h3 id="referenceFrames">Reference Frames</h3>
                    <img src="img/referenceFrames.png" class="img-responsive pull-right">
                    <p>All of physics is measured relative to something else. The conceptual idea of reference frames is best explained by the image here: from your frame of reference on the ground, the boy is moving from left to right; from the boy's frame of reference, he is standing still.</p>
                    <p>Before doing any measurements in physics, we must define our reference frame. For most problems, this means you must define:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> axes</li>
                        <li>The direction that positive (+) and negative (-) signs refer to</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This will become especially important when dealing with vectors.</p>

                    <h3 id="displacement">Displacement</h3>
                    <p>Displacement is defined as <b>the change in position of an object</b>. In other words, how far the object is from the starting point.</p>
                    <p>A good example of displacement: a person walks 70m west and 30m east. While their total distance travelled is 100m, their displacement is 40m to the west.</p>
                    <p>Displacement is a <b>vector quantity</b>, so make sure to include both magnitude and direction in your answer.</p>

                    <h3 id="speedVsVelocity">Speed vs Velocity</h3>
                    <p>Speed is the measure of how fast an object is moving. The <b>average speed</b> of an object is defined as:</p>
                    <div>$$average\ speed = {total\ distance\ travelled \over time\ elapsed}$$</div>
                    <p>On the other hand, velocity is the measure of how fast <em>and in what direction</em> an object is moving (it's a <em>vector quantity!</em>). The numerical value of "how fast" is also known as the <b>magnitude</b>. <b>Average velocity</b> is defined as <em>the displacement of an object over the time elapsed:</em></p>
                    <div>$$\bar v = {x_2 - x_1 \over t_2 - t_1} = {\Delta x \over \Delta t}$$</div>
                    <p>It's important to note that average speed uses <em>total distance</em> in its measurement as opposed to velocity, which uses <em>displacement</em> in its calculation. As a result, average speed and average velocity can be different for the same system.</p>

                        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Example problem:</h3></div>

                                <li>What was his <em>average speed</em>?</li>
                                <li>What was his <em>average velocity</em>?</li>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3 id="acceleration">Acceleration</h3>
                    <p>Acceleration specifies how rapidly the velocity of an object is changing. <b>Average acceleration</b> is defined as <em>the change in velocity divided by the time taken to make this change:</em></p>
                    <div>$$\bar a = {v_2 - v_1 \over t_2 - t_1} = {\Delta v \over \Delta t}$$</div>
                    <p>Acceleration is a <b>vector quantity</b>. Make sure to include the proper signage based on your chosen coordinate system.</p>

                    <h3 id="graphicalAnalysis">Graphical Analysis</h3>
                    <p>There's two main aspects to graphical analysis: determining the shape of a graph based on other graphs and determining the scalar quantity of certain measurements based on the area under a graph. We'll focus on both of them here.</p>
