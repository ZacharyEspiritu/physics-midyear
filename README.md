# Physics Midyear Study Guide 2016
An online study guide for Regis High School's Physics Midyear Exam on January 6, 2016. 

I'm mainly using this as an opportunity to kill three birds in one stone:
* Study Physics (obviously)
* Get some more HTML / CSS / Bootstrap practice
* Learn some LaTeX markup
